# Pokedex_Kotlin
 
 This app intention is to provide a little dictionary about pokemon's.
 
 Basically, the app will show a list of Pokemon's, with a textbox on top of it to the user search a pokemon for the name.
 
 The user can then click on any pokemon and will open a sreen with the details of that pokemon.
 
 Also, the user can favorite a pokemon and then view a list of all their favorite pokemon's.
 
 To build it, i will use MVVM and retrofit to consult pokemons a raw JSON.
